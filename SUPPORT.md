# Support LunarDAO Development

**Quality over speed**

Laying down the foundation of the DAO has been an ongoing work for several months, including feedback and redoing things. There are six [Stewards/core-team members](https://wiki.lunardao.net/governance.html#stewards) (that number includes Media committee as well as the initial [research done](https://wiki.lunardao.net/intro.html) before the [Research committee](https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1616859865024188419) was established). The core-team is enforced by several externals supporting with design, administration, legal questions, web3 development and [translations](https://wiki.lunardao.net/manifesto_tc.html).

We have decided to NOT open any private presale, neither VC rounds nor ask for any grants. Based on the community decision LunarDAO tabled the first tokenomics design/contracts and halted the planned Genesis token sale. Now we are building the [architecture v2](https://github.com/lunardao/dao) better aligned with the objectives. We stick to the plan and believe that the re-doing of the fundamentals is for the quality of LunarDAO [mission](https://wiki.lunardao.net/manifesto.html). However this exposes the core-team and supporting externals to the growing preasure of operational costs.

## Accepting Donations

LunarDAO Stewards were [proposed](https://forum.lunardao.net/t/tokenomics-lunar-vox/89/18?u=ogma) to accept donations in order to take more time for the needed development. The proposal was agreed upon in the [ircd community meeting](https://twitter.com/lunarpunksquad/status/1615001037949075456).

If you want to support the ongoing works, building the primitives and the deveopment leading towards the launch, we - the Stewards (core-team/founders) of LunarDAO accept donations to our shared multi-sig wallet:
